###**PG24 Pedro Intro to HTML Centipede Game**
----------

This is a web page in which we implemented the vintage game "Centipede" using HTML, CSS and Javascript


####**Download/Install**
---------
 - Download the GitHub repo (please, make sure to be on the "Final_Delivery" branch):

https://github.com/pg24pedro/PG24Pedro-Centipede.git

 -Download all contents into a folder and open the "index.html" file in VS Code.
 -Use Live Server to preview the page with the working script. 

####**How to use**
--------
-Arrow keys to move space ship.
-Spacebar to shoot.
-Play and pause buttons for music.


####**Caveats**
--------
I only managed to make the player and the centipide work. The mushrooms appear but do not detect any colision, as well as 
there's no score display nor play/pause button. I decided to recreate the app using canvas instead of a grid because I found
it easier to understand and to build uppon a code I wrote. Maybe if I had started earlier to work on the project, I would have figured 
out the rest of the functionality.
